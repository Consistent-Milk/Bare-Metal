1 -> Find an equation of a straight line
Input -> B(3, -3) | The required line will be parallel to PQ

Refinement : The required line will be parallel to PQ
-> The slope of the line will be the same as PQ 
    -> New Input -> Slope, m = - 4/9

Search for Process -> y - y1 = m(x-x1) -> This will be the required line
                   -> Are all inputs for the process available?
