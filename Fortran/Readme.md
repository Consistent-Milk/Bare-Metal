This part of the repo is developed using the Code::Blocks IDE, which makes it easier to manage Fortran projects
and linking extra subprocesses or libraries to the main application

The 'bin' folder contains executables.

Any subfolder here should be opened with with Code::Blocks IDE to use the project structure and configurations.

Some notes:
I am using MSYS to manage a MINGW environment. If you are not, then I suggest that you only copy the codes written in .f90 files and don't clone the repository.
