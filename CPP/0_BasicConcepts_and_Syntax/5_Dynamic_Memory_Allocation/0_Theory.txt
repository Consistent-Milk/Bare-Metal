Concepts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modern C++ dynamic memory management is based on smart pointers and the concept of RAII(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). 

RAII
----
For any resource that must be returned to the system when the program is done using it, the program should, 
-> Create the object as a local variable in a function. In the local scope the object's constructor should acquire the resource while initializing the object. 
-> Use the object as necessary
-> When the function call terminates, then the object also goes out of scope and the object's destructor should release the resource to free store.
