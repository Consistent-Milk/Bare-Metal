-> Compiled using --std=c++23 (Important because many methods are not implemented in the default selection,
which is usually --std=c++17)

-> Decided to not use 'using namespace std' as a personal practice, which may make the programs look more verbose than necessary. In my case, using std:: let's me know without thinking where some name is coming from. This might be more useful when working with several namespaces.
